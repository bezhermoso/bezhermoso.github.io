  <p><strong>2015-10-21 Update:</strong> Version 2.1 of <code>tmux</code> has just been release a couple
of days ago and from what I can tell it has addressed this fatal issue! So the
simpler solution would be doing <code>brew upgrade tmux</code> to get the recent release.
If you are stuck using 2.0 however, I hope this post is helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What fixed it for me was adding a single line to my <code>~/.zshrc</code> and a single line to my <code>~/.tmux.conf</code> file:</p>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># ~/.zshrc
tmux start-server</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># ~/.tmux.conf
new-session</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>It turns out, after trial and error, that the OS freezes (or in worst cases, kernel panics on older OS X versions) usually happen
when you close the very last of all <code>tmux</code> pane of the very last <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

<p>With these additions to my config files, a <code>tmux</code> server is started with an empty <code>tmux</code> session whenever I fire up a terminal
window for the first time. This means that I always have an empty <code>tmux</code> session – still active although never used – even after
I exit out all the sessions I create on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I never had my MacBook Pro grind to a stop as soon as I close out all <code>tmux</code>
sessions and having to forcibly turn it off.</p>

<p>This does not fix <code>tmux</code>, but is a simple work-around for a problem that has
a potential to incur data loss in the future.</p>
