Hi! My name is Bez Hermoso, and I'm a senior software engineer at [ActiveLAMP](http://activelamp.com).
I've been working with a bunch of Symfony projects lately so my posts would tend to be about my misadventures
and thoughts about it and other related technologies.
I've been writing some bits in Python and Ruby also so maybe I'll write a stuff or two about that, too. Happy coding!
