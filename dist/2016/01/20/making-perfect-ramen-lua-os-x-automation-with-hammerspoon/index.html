I find Lua&#39;s simplicity refreshing. I found it easy to pick up the basics of Lua and start writing something in it, and was able to just learn more as I went.

One such annoyance pertains to switching focus between multiple displays:I have a dual-display setup at work and I have all my GUI applications running on theprimary display, with the exception of a couple of full-screen terminal windows running tmux, vim, a zsh shell, monitoring tools, logs, etc. occupying theentirety of a secondary screen across multiple Spaces. I also have other full-screen applicationsliving in their own Spaces on the primary display. My setup works really well for me most of the time, butthere are certain combinations of circumstances on how applications are laid out across allSpaces and the order in which I have accessed them that results in a state whereCommand (⌘)-Tab or a three-finger swipe doesn’t bring me where I want to go.

<h3 id="cycle-displays">1. Cycle through displays</h3>

<p>I wanted to start small, so I picked a little annoyance I find myself battling with daily and aimed to solve it. One such annoyance pertains to switching focus between multiple displays:</p>

<p>I have a dual-display setup at work and I have all my GUI applications running on the
primary display, with the exception of a couple of full-screen terminal windows running <code>tmux</code>, <code>vim</code>, a <code>zsh</code> shell, monitoring tools, logs, <em>etc.</em> occupying the
entirety of a secondary screen across multiple Spaces. I also have other full-screen applications
living in their own Spaces on the primary display. My setup works really well for me most of the time, but
there are certain combinations of circumstances on how applications are laid out across all
Spaces and the order in which I have accessed them that results in a state where
Command (⌘)-Tab or a three-finger swipe doesn’t bring me where I want to go. So my
first challenge was to make something in Hammerspoon that would allow me to
cycle through the displays with <strong><em>consistency</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Here is my solution:</p>

  hs.timer.doAfter(3 * 60, function ()
    hs.notify.new({
        title=&quot;Ramen time!&quot;,
        informativeText=&quot;Your ramen is ready!&quot;
    }):send()
  end)
  hs.alert(&quot; Ramen timer started! &quot;)

hs.urlevent.bind(&quot;ramentime&quot;, startRamenTimer)

<p>Hammerspoon’s <code>hs.urlevent</code> is a beautiful thing: it allows you to bind some
action to a URL with a <code>hammerspoon://</code> scheme. This makes Hammerspoon actions
almost universally accessible! In this case, opening <code>hammerspoon://ramentime</code> will start the timer. Now, we can if we want create a bookmarklet on the browser’s
toolbar pointing to it that when clicked will activate the timer.</p>

<p>Because of the portability of URL schemes, I was able to create a very basic <em>Alfred Workflow</em> that triggers the timer. have to do is type <code>ramen</code> into <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/"><strong>Alfred</strong></a> to ensure prime ramen all the time:</p>

<p>Another nifty thing you can do is create a dictation command to trigger the timer.
Enable <em>Dictation</em> on your Mac, go to <em>System Preferences &gt; Accessibility
Dictation...</em>, click the <em>Dictation Commands...</em> button, and turn on <em>Enable advanced
commands</em>.
From here you can add a new voice command in the list and configure it to open the
time via URL. Have fun!</p>

<p>If you are into automating things on your Mac, give <em>Hammerspoon</em> a spin. You
might like it, too.</p>
