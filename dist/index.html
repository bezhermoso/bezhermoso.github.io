            <time datetime="2018-07-28T00:00:00-07:00">28 Jul 2018</time>
          </div>
          <article class="excerpt">
            <p>You want to jump back up to your project’s root directory from who knows many levels down. What would you do? Figure out the right amount of levels to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd ../../..</code> up? Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code> repeatedly until you get there? or run <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to an absolute path directly?</p>

<p>If your project is managed with Git, here is a smarter way:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">$ cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The command <code class="highlighter-rouge">git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code> is a Git plumbing command that outputs the absolute path of the Git repository root of the project you are in. Therefore the most straight-forward form is to use its result as the argument for <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>. <strong>No more repeating commands, figuring out exactly how far up the root is, or having to type out paths!</strong></p>

<p>The next obvious step is to make an alias of that command in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> or equivalent file:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Mnemonic: `gr` == `git root`
# Also note the single-quotes; you don't want the sub-command to run on alias definition!
alias gr='cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)'</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>From here on out, just run <code class="highlighter-rouge">gr</code> anytime you need to jump all the way up to your project root.</p>

<p>We can take it a little further…</p>

<hr />

<p>What used to be this <code class="highlighter-rouge">gr</code> alias on my rc file evolved into a full-on shell function that handles some edge-cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do nothing when I’m not in the project root instead of spitting an error and jumping to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code></li>
  <li>Be smart with Git submodules: if already in a repo’s root, jump up to the nearest parent repo in the tree, if any.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here it is in it’s current form in my rc file (<a href="https://github.com/bezhermoso/jump-to-git-root">I hosted this on Github</a> if you’d like to clone it instead):</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">

    exit 1
  fi
  local _pwd=$(pwd)
  if [[ $_pwd = $_root_dir ]]; then
    # Handle submodules:
    # If parent dir is also managed under Git then we are in a submodule.
    # If so, cd to nearest Git parent project.
    _root_dir=&quot;$(git -C $(dirname $_pwd) rev-parse --show-toplevel 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;
    if [[ $? -gt 0 ]]; then
      echo &quot;Already at Git repo root.&quot;
      return 0
    fi
  fi

            <p>If there is one tool I use the most, it has to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code>. I do almost everything <em>in</em> it.</p>

<p>However, as useful as it is, I feel like its not very user-friendly out-of-the-box. This post is a collection of things in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.tmux.conf</code> that makes <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> easier to use and to bring its more powerful capabilities within closer reach.</p>

  </div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-s</code> requires far less finger-flinging than the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-b</code> – the keys are close enough together, and it doesn’t conflict with any key-sequence I commonly use. This is extra awesome with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Capslock</code> mapped to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + s</code> is typically bound in terminals to “stop output to screen”. I can live without it, as entering  “Visual Mode” in <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> is a functional alternative.</p>

<h2 id="fix-clipboard-integration-on-macos--vi-style-bindings">Fix clipboard integration on macOS + vi-style bindings</h2>

<p>Support for copying and pasting to the system clipboard doesn’t quite work on macOS. Thankfully, getting it to work takes very little effort.</p>

<p>First you need to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">reattach-to-user-namespace</code> program. You can grab it straight from Homebrew:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Add this to <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.tmux.conf</code> and you are off to the races:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Check whether we are on macOS / OS X
if-shell 'test &quot;$(uname)&quot; = &quot;Darwin&quot;' \
  'set-option -g default-command &quot;reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh&quot;' ''

# vi bindings in copy-mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Bind `v` to enter VISUAL-like selection mode.
bind-key -t vi-copy v begin-selection
bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe &quot;reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy&quot;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="intuitive-window-splitting">Intuitive window splitting</h2>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Horizontal split (left &amp; right):
bind-key \ split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}'
# Verical split (top &amp; bottom):
bind-key - split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}'</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Compared to the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; %</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; "</code>, these bindings makes which way splits occur <em>really</em> obvious. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-c #{pane_current_path}</code> argument passed will start new splits in the same working directory you are on.</p>

<p>As of version 2.3, <code class="highlighter-rouge">split-window</code> now understands the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-f</code> flag, which indicates full-width or full-height splits. These are perfect when you want a “scratch” shell to appear on the bottom or to the right of everything else:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># For tmux 2.3 or newer
# Full-height horizontal split with 33% width:
bind-key | split-window -fh -c '#{pane_current_path}' -p 33
# Full-width vertical split with 33% height:
bind-key _ split-window -fv -c '#{pane_current_path}' -p 33</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="tiered-navigation-controls">Tiered navigation controls</h2>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Move between windows/tabs with `o` and `p`:
bind-key -r p next-window
bind-key -r o previous-window

# Move between splits vi-style:
bind-key -r h select-pane -L
bind-key -r j select-pane -D
bind-key -r k select-pane -U
bind-key -r l select-pane -R</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Although the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; n</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; p</code> are easier to remember (<em>“next”</em> and <em>“previous”</em>), I find moving between windows faster with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; o</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; p</code> as they are right next to each other. I happen to like vim-style cursor movements, so binding split navigations to <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; {h,j,k,l}</code> is just logical.</p>

<p>With this configuration,  the navigation controls are tiered:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Pane navigation</em></strong>: I can use home-row keys in vi-like bindings to move between panes in the current window.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Window navigation</em></strong>: I can find <code class="highlighter-rouge">o</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> right above the home-row keys to move between windows or “tabs” in the current session.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Session navigation</em></strong>: Above <code class="highlighter-rouge">o</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> I can use the parentheses keys to move between various sessions.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code> flag marks the bindings repeatable – this means they will not bring you out of prefix-mode after invocation, allowing you to repeat them or even invoke other bindings right after.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="moving-panes-to-another-window">Moving panes to another window</h2>

<p>It’s possible to move panes between different windows using <code class="highlighter-rouge">join-pane</code>. However it is slightly cumbersome to use (you have to pass in the window’s index as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-t</code> argument). However using <code class="highlighter-rouge">choose-window</code> makes it as easy as selecting a window from a list:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Move pane to a different window. You can choose window from a list:
bind-key m choose-window -F &quot;#{window_index}: #{window_name}&quot; &quot;join-pane -h -t %%&quot;
bind-key M choose-window -F &quot;#{window_index}: #{window_name}&quot; &quot;join-pane -v -t %%&quot;

# Swap windows. Choose window to swap with from a list:
bind-key c-w choose-window -F &quot;#{window_index}: #{window_name}&quot; &quot;swap-window -t %1&quot;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>You can pick a window from a list and the current pane will be sent there as a horizontal split. <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; M</code> will do the same, but will result in a vertical split.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; C-w</code> in will bring up a list of all windows. The current window will swap places with the one you select.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="resizing-panes">Resizing panes</h2>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Resize panes directionally via vi-style bindings
bind-key -r C-k resize-pane -u 5
bind-key -r C-j resize-pane -d 5
bind-key -r C-h resize-pane -l 5
bind-key -r C-l resize-pane -r 5</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>These binds <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; C-{h,j,k,l}</code> to resize the current window by 5 columns or rows, depending on the direction. I find resizing 1 unit at a time takes a bit too long and I rarely need precise control. Resizing by 5 units is just right.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="natural-numbering">Natural numbering</h2>

<p>Speaking of window indices, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> starts numbering things at 0. Zero-based index is second nature to programmers and all, but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> key does not appear next to <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> on any keyboard. It’s awkward for this purpose.
I think its more natural to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> starting counting from 1:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Begin numbering at 1:
set -g base-index 1
set -g pane-base-index 1

# Maintain ordinality after swapping windows; and also make sure there is no gaps after killing windows:
set -g renumber-windows on</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<h2 id="closing-panes--windows">Closing panes &amp; windows</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; x</code> to close the pane, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; X</code> to close the window, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; Q</code> to quit the session:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">bind-key x confirm-before -p &quot;kill-pane #P? (y/n)&quot; kill-pane
bind-key X confirm-before -p &quot;Kill window #W? (y/n)&quot; kill-window
bind-key Q confirm-before -p &quot;Kill session #S? (y/n)&quot; kill-session</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>A prompt will be presented to confirm the action.</p>

<h2 id="synchronize-panes">Synchronize panes</h2>

<p>Another neat trick that <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> can do is synchronizing key-strokes across all panes in a window. I thought <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;prefix&gt; &amp;</code> is an apt binding to toggle the behavior:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">bind-key &amp; set-window-option synchronize-panes</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

          <article class="excerpt">
            <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">vim-gnupg</code> provides transparent PGP encryption/decryption when editing <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.gpg</code> <em>et al</em> files with <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim</code>. Sadly, if you are using a TTY-based pinentry your GNUPG setup like <code class="highlighter-rouge">pinentry-curses</code>, <a href="https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg/issues/32">it won’t work</a> (with no fault from the plugin author).</p>

<p>The trick to get it to work is to somehow tell the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gpg-agent</code> to use an external pinentry program when triggered by <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim-gnupg</code>. For this, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pinentry-mac</code> program fits the bill:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">$ brew install pinentry-mac</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Configure <code class="highlighter-rouge">gpg-agent</code> to use it as the pinentry program:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Configure your shell to use the TTY-based pinentry in most circumstances:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc, etc. :

GPG_TTY=$(tty)
# Tell the pinentry program to use the nice, full-screen pinentry program:
export PINENTRY_USER_DATA=&quot;USE_CURSES=1&quot;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Restart your terminal application (or source your config file), then restart the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gpg-agent</code>:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">$ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Now it’s just a matter of configuring <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim-gnupg</code> to override the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PINENTRY_USER_DATA</code> so that PGP prompts will use the GUI pinentry:</p>

<div class="code-section">
  <div class="filename">
    <div class="row">

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
      <pre><code class="language-vim">let g:GPGExecutable = &quot;PINENTRY_USER_DATA='' gpg --trust-model always&quot;</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now, whenever you edit/write PGP encrypted files in Neovim, the GUI pinentry will be used and <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim-gnupg</code> should start working as expected.</p>

            <p>Here is a convenient &amp; versatile yet stependously easy trick you can do in Google Chrome, leveraging the built-in custom search engine functionality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <strong><em>Chrome Menu » Settings » Manage search engines… (under Search)</em></strong> and scroll all the way down to the <strong><em>Other search engines</em></strong> section.</li>
  <li>Add a new entry:
    <ul>
      <li>Name: Anything you like (i.e. <em>“Subreddit”</em>)</li>
      <li>Keyword: <strong>r</strong></li>
      <li>URL: <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://reddit.com/r/%s</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p><br />
  <img src="/img/chrome-quick-switch-setup.png" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, Whenever you want to visit a subreddit, simply jump to the <em>Address Bar</em> (<em>Alt + D</em> or <em>F5</em> on Windows/Linux, <em>Command + L</em> on Mac), type in <em>“r”</em>, hit <em>Tab</em>, followed by the subreddit and then hit <em>Enter</em>; and you should be taken there.</p>

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:39%"><iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/WeakNauticalAvocet" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<hr />

<h4 id="its-not-for-reddit-only">It’s not for Reddit only</h4>

<p>This is obviously not limited to the use for subreddits; you can create multiple other quick-switching “profiles” triggered by different keywords to bring you to other website URLs you visit/navigate to-and-fro frequently.</p>

<p>For example, if your organization uses Jira, you can set-up the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name: Jira</li>
  <li>Keyword: <strong>j</strong></li>
  <li>URL: <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://&lt;ORG NAME&gt;.atlassian.net/browse/%s</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to quickly navigate to any project or issue via typing <em>“j”</em>, hitting <em>Tab</em>, followed by the project/issue number in the <em>Address Bar</em>.</p>

<p>You are also not limited to create substitutions to the path segment of URLs; you can configure it to fill in any part of URLs; for example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://%s.google.com</code> will let you switch to the various Google services, etc.</p>

          <article class="excerpt">
            <p>Yesterday I discovered <strong><a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org">Hammerspoon</a></strong>, a project
that touts itself as a <em>“tool for powerful automation of OS X”</em>. After giving
it a try, not only did I find that statement to be true, but as someone who has
<strong>ZERO</strong> prior practical experience with Lua, I was surprised by how relatively easy it was to
get on board. Now, I’m hooked.</p>

<h2 id="lua-scripting"><strong>Lua scripting</strong></h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="columns large-6">
    <p>
<em>Hammerspoon</em> exposes system level APIs into a Lua environment, and config files
are written in Lua.
    </p>
    <p>
    Syntactically, Lua reminds me a lot of Javascript and Ruby and, by extension, CoffeeScript. If you write in any of these three languages,
    you already have a leg up on the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
    I find Lua's simplicity refreshing. I found it easy to pick up the basics of <em>Lua</em> and start writing something in it, and was able to just learn more as I went. Functions are first-class citizens in Lua (can be passed around as arguments or as return values) so familiarity with functional programming paradigms goes a long way.
    </p>

    </div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>However, unlike Javascript and Ruby, Lua does not have a built-in
functional library to do things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">reduce</code>,
<em>etc.</em>, but Hammerspoon comes with <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.fnutils.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">hs.fnutils</code></a> which provides a bunch of
functional utilities. Its not exhaustive, but its good enough for not-so-complex
scripting which Hammerspoon falls into.</p>

<h3 id="cycle-displays">1. Cycle through displays</h3>

<p>I wanted to start small, so I picked a little annoyance I find myself battling with daily and aimed to solve it. One such annoyance pertains to switching focus between multiple displays:</p>

<p>I have a dual-display setup at work and I have all my GUI applications running on the
primary display, with the exception of a couple of full-screen terminal windows running <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim</code>, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">zsh</code> shell, monitoring tools, logs, <em>etc.</em> occupying the
entirety of a secondary screen across multiple Spaces. I also have other full-screen applications
living in their own Spaces on the primary display. My setup works really well for me most of the time, but
there are certain combinations of circumstances on how applications are laid out across all
Spaces and the order in which I have accessed them that results in a state where
Command (⌘)-Tab or a three-finger swipe doesn’t bring me where I want to go. So my
first challenge was to make something in Hammerspoon that would allow me to
cycle through the displays with <strong><em>consistency</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Here is my solution:</p>

<div class="code-section">
  <div class="filename">
    <div class="row">

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
      <pre><code class="language-lua">-- DISPLAY FOCUS SWITCHING --

--One hotkey should just suffice for dual-display setups as it will naturally
--cycle through both.
--A second hotkey to reverse the direction of the focus-shift would be handy
--for setups with 3 or more displays.

--Bring focus to next display/screen
hs.hotkey.bind({&quot;alt&quot;}, &quot;`&quot;, function ()
  focusScreen(hs.window.focusedWindow():screen():next())
end)

--Bring focus to previous display/screen
hs.hotkey.bind({&quot;alt&quot;, &quot;shift&quot;}, &quot;`&quot;, function()
  focusScreen(hs.window.focusedWindow():screen():previous())
end)

--Predicate that checks if a window belongs to a screen
function isInScreen(screen, win)
  return win:screen() == screen
end

-- Brings focus to the scren by setting focus on the front-most application in it.
-- Also move the mouse cursor to the center of the screen. This is because
-- Mission Control gestures &amp; keyboard shortcuts are anchored, oddly, on where the
-- mouse is focused.
function focusScreen(screen)
  --Get windows within screen, ordered from front to back.
  --If no windows exist, bring focus to desktop. Otherwise, set focus on
  --front-most application window.
  local windows = hs.fnutils.filter(
      hs.window.orderedWindows(),
      hs.fnutils.partial(isInScreen, screen))
  local windowToFocus = #windows &gt; 0 and windows[1] or hs.window.desktop()
  windowToFocus:focus()

  -- Move mouse to center of screen
  local pt = geometry.rectMidPoint(screen:fullFrame())
  mouse.setAbsolutePosition(pt)
end

-- END DISPLAY FOCUS SWITCHING --</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With this in place, I can now confidently move across applications (and
subsequently, across Spaces) with a few key-strokes. Thanks to Lua’s concise syntax and <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/">Hammerspoon’s well-documented API</a>, this only took a few minutes to write. As you can see, binding hotkeys to custom actions are trivial with Hammerspoon.</p>

<h3 id="webpage-on-wifi-connect">2. Open a web-page as soon as I connect to a particular WiFi network</h3>

<p>I admit I am a forgetful person, especially when it comes to relatively small routine stuff.
At work we use Zenefits to keep track of our working hours, clocking in and
clocking out from within their web portal. I don’t feel confident that I will
always remember to clock first thing in the morning, so I naturally started
looking for applications that I could configure to somehow remind me to clock in whenever I connect to our office’s network. I initially used <a href="http://www.controlplaneapp.com/">ControlPlane</a> for this and it worked well. But why not do it in Hammerspoon now that I got my feet wet?</p>

local employeeDashboardUrl = &quot;https://secure.zenefits.com/dashboard/#/&quot;
local defaultBrowser = &quot;Google Chrome&quot;

hs.wifi.watcher.new(function ()
  local currentWifi = wifi.currentNetwork()
  -- short-circuit if disconnecting
  if not currentWifi then return end

  local note = hs.notify.new({
    title=&quot;Connected to WiFi&quot;,
    informativeText=&quot;Now connected to &quot; .. currentWifi
  }):send()

  --Dismiss notification in 3 seconds
  --Notification does not auto-withdraw if Hammerspoon is set to use &quot;Alerts&quot;
  --in System Preferences &gt; Notifications
  hs.timer.doAfter(3, function ()
    note:withdraw()
    note = nil
  end)

  if currentWifi == workWifi then
    -- Allowance for internet connectivity delays.
    hs.timer.doAfter(3, function ()
      -- @todo: Explore possibilities of using `hs.webview`
      hs.execute(&quot;open &quot; .. employeeDashboardUrl)

      --Make notification clickable. Browser window will be focused on click:
      hs.notify.new(function ()
        hs.application.launchOrFocus(defaultBrowser)
      end, {title=&quot;Make sure you clock in!&quot;}):send()
    end)
  end
end):start()

-- END WORK-RELATED AUTOMATION --</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Next thing to automate is opening <em>Tempo Timesheets</em> in Jira every 2 hours as
long as I’m in our ofice network to remind me to put in worklogs.</p>

<h3 id="perfect-ramen">3. Make perfect ramen every time</h3>

<p>A hot, 3-minute ramen is good. Sometimes its better <em>al-dente</em>. But warm, soggy, 10-minute ramen? Not cool.</p>

<p>For better ramen:</p>

  hs.timer.doAfter(3 * 60, function ()
    hs.notify.new({
        title=&quot;Ramen time!&quot;,
        informativeText=&quot;Your ramen is ready!&quot;
    }):send()
  end)
  hs.alert(&quot; Ramen timer started! &quot;)
end

--Bind timer to `hammerspoon://ramentime`:
hs.urlevent.bind(&quot;ramentime&quot;, startRamenTimer)

-- END RAMEN TIMER --</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hammerspoon’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">hs.urlevent</code> is a beautiful thing: it allows you to bind some
action to a URL with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">hammerspoon://</code> scheme. This makes Hammerspoon actions
almost universally accessible! In this case, opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">hammerspoon://ramentime</code> will start the timer. Now, we can if we want create a bookmarklet on the browser’s
toolbar pointing to it that when clicked will activate the timer.</p>

<p>Because of the portability of URL schemes, I was able to create a very basic <em>Alfred Workflow</em> that triggers the timer. have to do is type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ramen</code> into <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/"><strong>Alfred</strong></a> to ensure prime ramen all the time:</p>

            <p>I think one glaring omission from OS X’s huge set of handy keyboard shortcuts for
common functionality is the ability to dismiss all alert notifications using a global hotkey. Right now,
the only way to clear out a backlog is to click on the <em>“Close”</em> button on each and every single notification item.
Going through a backlog of alert notifications is a constant dilemma I face on a normal work day,
and I was suprised when I learned there is no other way of dimissing alert notifications that is more efficient.</p>

<p>I actually <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/155736A">found a solution</a> by <strong><em>markhunte</em></strong> from <em>Ask Different</em> which worked
quite well in the beginning. The solution in a nutshell is creating a custom service using <em>Automator</em>
which executes a workflow that runs an <em>AppleScript</em> snippet that automates the
dismissal of notifications, and assigning a global hotkey to execute it.</p>

<p>The solution works well but only when OS X cooperates – running the
workflow within <em>Automator</em> cause zero problems, but making it work through
a keyboard shortcut is hit-and-miss. I found myself mucking around with accessibility settings in <em>System
Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy</em> a lot, adding system applications
tucked away in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Library/CoreServices/</code> to the <em>Accessibility</em> list before getting it to work for
the first time, until I discovered that the service simply fails with no
explanation when invoked while I have certain applications in focus.</p>

<p>Eventually I figured out a more reliable way to accomplish this using a third-party application called <a href="http://www.boastr.net"><strong>BetterTouchTool</strong></a>.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="columns large-7 text-justify">
    <p>
        I'll also share additional workflows I wrote that allows you to perform more fine-grained actions like acting on one
        notification item at a time, i.e. dismissing it, clicking it, or clicking on
        the secondary action if available. This is great for those alert notifications
        that supports quick reply:

<p>There is a number of productivity applications out there that allows you to invoke an Automator workflow

<p>However, I personally use <strong><a href="http://www.boastr.net/">BetterTouchTool</a></strong> as I already have
it installed to accomplish similar tasks.</p>

<p><img src="/img/bettertouchtool.png" /></p>

<p>My mapping is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">⇧ ⌥ ⌘ ]</code> - Dismiss all notifications</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">⌥ ⌘ ]</code> - Dismiss top-most notification</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">⌥ ⌘ [</code> - Click top-most notification</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">⌥ ⌘ '</code> - Click secondary action on top-most notification</li>
</ul>

<div class="row">
    <div class="columns large-6">
        <p>
            <em>BetterTouchTool</em> is a really handy application all in all that will allow you to map an unthinkable amount of things to keyboard
            shortcuts, mouse &amp; trackpad gestures, and a bunch of other peripherals.
            It has been a free application for a very long time, but
            it won't be long until the <em>"pay as much as you want"</em> licensing model will take into
            effect. But I highly recommend it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important</strong>: If you just installed <em>BetterTouchTool</em>, you will have to grant it access to accessibility services on your system. Go to <em>System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy</em>, and add <em>BetterTouchTool</em> to the list under <em>Accessibility</em>.

<p>Try it out! Go ahead and prune thorugh your alert notifications with more effiency. Or, actually learn to turn on <em>“Do Not Disturb”</em> once in a while (no judgement here – I am also guilty of this.)</p>

  <p><strong>Extra keyboard-fu protip:</strong> You can quickly toggle <em>“Do Not Disturb”</em> by Option-clicking
on the <em>Notification Center</em> icon on the menu bar, or you can actually assign
a global hotkey to toggle it in <em>System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts

simpler solution would be doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew upgrade tmux</code> to get the recent release.
If you are stuck using 2.0 however, I hope this post is helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What fixed it for me was adding a single line to my <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.zshrc</code> and a single line to my <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.tmux.conf</code> file:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># ~/.zshrc

      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># ~/.tmux.conf
new-session</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>It turns out, after trial and error, that the OS freezes (or in worst cases, kernel panics on older OS X versions) usually happen
when you close the very last of all <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> pane of the very last <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> session.</p>

<p>With these additions to my config files, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> server is started with an empty <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> session whenever I fire up a terminal
window for the first time. This means that I always have an empty <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> session – still active although never used – even after
I exit out all the sessions I create on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I never had my MacBook Pro grind to a stop as soon as I close out all <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code>
sessions and having to forcibly turn it off.</p>

<p>This does not fix <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code>, but is a simple work-around for a problem that has
a potential to incur data loss in the future.</p>

            <p>Last night I decided to make the switch from using purely Homebrew to
manage my local machine’s PHP version to using
<a href="https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew"><strong>phpbrew</strong></a>. However the switch was
without any issues.</p>

<p>I needed to install PHP version 5.6.14 with <code class="highlighter-rouge">mcrypt</code>:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; phpbrew install 5.6.14 +default+mcrypt</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>However the build process keeps failing. Inspecting the build log gives me the following errors
at different stages of troubleshooting:</p>

<pre class="highlight language-text"><code class="language-text">configure: error: Cannot find OpenSSL's &lt;evp.h&gt;</code></pre>

<pre class="highlight language-text"><code class="language-text">configure: error: Please reinstall the BZip2 distribution</code></pre>

<pre class="highlight language-text"><code class="language-text">ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) make: *** [sapi/cli/php] Error 1</code></pre>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>What I ended up having to do was re-install XCode Command-Line Tools and install
a few libraries via Homebrew (because apparently, OS X does not ship them, or
ship older versions):</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; xcode-select --install
&gt; brew install openssl libxml2 mcrypt
&gt; brew link openssl libxml2 --force</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And that’s it! The build completed, and now I have PHP 5.6.14 available
whenever I want it.</p>

<p>If you are encountering these errors, I hope this helps you. Or if you haven’t attempted it yet but are planning to build PHP with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">phpbrew</code>, I hope this will save you the trouble.</p>

            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional programming</a> has been gaining popularity lately. It’s an interesting paradigm for solving problems and departs quite a bit from familiar concepts programmers like me who use object-oriented languages are used to.
Just like object-oriented programming, it has its own sets of design principles and philosophies. I don’t pretend to know a lot of them – in fact I only have barely scratched the surface, but two concepts has stood
out to me so far – its the concept of <em>high-order functions</em> and the slew of interesting things you can do with them.</p>

<h2 id="high-order-functions">High-order functions</h2>

<p><strong>high-order functions</strong> are simply functions that operate on <em>other</em> functions, by taking them as arguments are having functions as a return value (so meta). This is one of things you find in a languages like Haskell and Erlang (so I’ve heard) or even Javascript barring some short-comings where functions are first-class citizens, which is a cool way of saying that they can be treated like any other value i.e., you can assign them to a variable, append them to an array, pass them around as function arguments or return them as return values, etc. i.e. In Javascript, <code class="highlighter-rouge">function foo () {}</code> is equivalent to <code class="highlighter-rouge">var foo = function() {}</code>.</p>

            <p>After reading a brief on <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, I decided to use it instead of MongoDB for a pet project and
began diving right in. <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/cradle">Cradle</a>, a CouchDB client for Node.js, was one <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> away. Installing CouchDB and creating the database was a breeze. I was able to quickly store data
and refined the structure when needed. Gotta love NoSQL!</p>

<p>Querying data is where it got a bit more interesting: fetching data requires the creation
of <em>views</em>. This is unlike other popular data stores that has their own query DSLs (domain-specific language), like
SQL for SQL-flavored RDBMS, JSON-based query DSLs for MongoDB and other NoSQL stores.</p>

<p>CouchDB views are simply applications of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a> paradigm. In a nutshell, you provide
map functions and/or reduce functions which will be used to narrow down the data-set and/or to reduce
a data-set into a single aggregate value. Sounds easy. So I went ahead and pecked these on my keyboard:

            <p>Sometimes your project has some server-side dependencies that aren’t PHP libraries but which your PHP application can’t run without. Or they could be assets that you don’t want in your code repository, like huge database fixtures that you only need during dev and integration testing. Instead of adding them to your Git repository or any VCS of choice, why not use Composer to resolve them?</p>

<p>If you are not aware what <strong>Composer</strong> is, then I think you are missing out. Essentially it is a dependency manager for PHP. It’s kinda like PEAR, but its so much better. It allows you to define your external library dependencies in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer.json</code> file, typically on your project root, and have it resolve and download them for you, including your dependencies’ own dependencies. Its an awesome, widely-adopted tool which greatly improves the PHP developers’ quality-of-life.

<hr />

<p>In the previous post, we added a new service named <code class="highlighter-rouge">thehunt_sitemap.annotation_link_collector</code>, which gathers metadata from annotations on
controllers. This is somewhat similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">thehunt_sitemap.link_collector</code>, although this one reads YAML files instead of annotations, and has a
thin caching layer. However both of them have similarities, which is being able to produce a list of links. Afterall, this is their ultimate responsibility; from
where they gather links from are just implementation details.</p>

            <p>I’ve been using a lot of the <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html">Symfony Form</a> component lately to handle
input in REST endpoints.
Instead of handling the parameters myself within controllers, I use forms to do it for me for various reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It keeps the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/damiansromek/thin-controllers-fat-models-proper-code-structure-for-mvc">controllers thin</a>.</li>
  <li>It makes the definition of the parameters explicit. The form itself serves as the documentation of what the REST endpoint will
accept as valid input.</li>
  <li>It makes validation a breeze thanks to how the Form component integates with <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html">Symfony Validation.</a></li>
  <li>It makes our Swagger API documentation up-to-date with our code at all times,
thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioApiDocBundle">NelmioApiDocBundle</a></li>
  <li>It helps making changes to the endpoint’s interface a lot easier.</li>
  <li>…and quite importantly, <strong>it makes the parameter handling and validation testable</strong>.</li>

            <p>There seems to be quite a sizable portion of the PHP community that think that PHP annotations are a <a href="http://www.marclewis.com/2013/10/25/php_annotations_are_a_bad_idea/">bad idea</a>.
However, there is also a sizable portion that think that PHP annotations is not evil, and maybe actually a godsend, if the wide-spread usage is of any indication.</p>

<p>Personally I acknowledge that using them can be pain to deal with in when used in the wrong places, but I also think that it has a place in a limited set of areas.
It provides a lot of convenience with almost to zero drawbacks if used within the bounds of the domain exclusive to your app, but it can cause a lot of coupling when used to define metadata on
third-party libraries/bundles that you hope to plug into your app, making it brittle. I think this is rooted in the fact that there is currently no easy way to override configuration specified via annotations,
or actually to support such mechanism.</p>

<p>There is also the problem that the configuration will reside where the subjected class is on. This poses a huge problem when you
try to add configuration on a third-party class. Going in and modifying a class shipped by a third-party library is obviously a very
horrible idea. I was faced with this problem when trying to document a REST API I was writing using <a href="https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php">Swagger-PHP</a>: since I was using
<a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle">FOSUserBundle</a> and extending its <code class="highlighter-rouge">User</code> class for use in my app, I was faced with two
possible approaches:</p>

            <p><strong>Some back-story:</strong> In the course of contributing some <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger">Swagger</a>-specific features
to the awesome <a href="https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioApiDocBundle">NelmioApiDocBundle</a>,
 the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Symfony\Component\Config\ConfigCache</code> class was brought to my attention. To give you an idea how this fits in, you
 should know that the bundle generates an HTML page
 documenting your REST API. It gets the needed information from metadata declared as <code class="highlighter-rouge">@ApiDoc</code> annotations in controllers
 in the Symfony app. On top of that, the bundle also processes metadata from different libraries:
 integration with <a href="https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSSerializerBundle">JmsSerializerBundle</a>,
 Symfony’s <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html">Validator</a>
 and <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/routing.html">Routing</a> component,
 <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle">FOSRestBundle</a> is built-in.</p>

<p>All these libraries does a good amount of caching on their end. However, <code class="highlighter-rouge">NelmioApiDocBundle</code> does not.
 This means, every time the documentation page is being viewed, all documentation metadata is being re-built.
 Although it did not present any significant performance issues in the beginning, it is apparent that things can speed up a bit if we could skip
 all these steps if none of the configuration regarding routes, serialization, or validation hasn’t changed at all.
 I mean, how often do they change in production, anyway?</p>

            <p>If there is one adjective to describe this book, it would be that it is <em>very informative</em>. This is a perfect companion for when you are a ZF2 developer that is starting to develop your first app. I wish this was available to me when I just started on mine. This would save
you a lot of time trying to figure out how things work and how to implement solutions to common problems (routing, navigation, authentication, etc) and let you focus on
business requirements that are specific to your project.</p>

<p>This book covers a lot of ground, which is what you could hope for from a cookbook. The ZF2 team and contributors has done
a great job with the official documentation, and this book is a great supplement to it. What makes this a good addition to the official docs
is the fact that each recipe uses more than one Zend components to build out a solution. The official docs helped me see how each component can be used by themselves,
but this cookbook gives concrete examples on how they can be used in conjunction with others as a part of a bigger picture. This cookbook reveals one of ZF2’s biggest strength which
is its modularity and shows you ways how to wield it.</p>

            <p>A month ago when I was writing a bundle that I needed for a Symfony project, I was presented with a challenge that I couldn’t quite figure how to solve:
I needed to locate files from with other bundles’ <code class="highlighter-rouge">Resources/</code> directory during my bundle’s “bootstrap” phase. Basically, I was trying to configure a service
definition to pass in an array of file paths to YAML files that are scattered across different bundles as an argument.</p>

<p>Normally, you could just do something like this to get the absolute file path to a file from within any bundle:</p>

<div class="code-section">
  <div class="filename">
    <div class="row">

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-12 columns">
      <pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

$location = $this-&gt;container-&gt;get('kernel')-&gt;locateResource('@FooBundle/Resources/config/foo_metadata.yml');

/** do stuff **/</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>However, since I needed to perform this during the early stages of the application life-cycle – even before the compiler is even compiled – the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kernel</code> service isn’t available yet.</p>

            <p>My new job at ActiveLAMP has put me in a position where I get to use and learn a wider set of technologies. And its a great
position to be in. Instead of confining myself with the boundaries of the LAMP stack, now I am working on projects with
requirements that necessitate the use of other technologies to achieve specific aspects of the product that are particularly
demanding on their own right that the the unholy quadro that is Linux-Apache2-MySQL-PHP just isn’t sufficient anymore.</p>

<p>For one project I have to learn and work with <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to provide performant and speedy search capabilities, which include
fuzzy full-text searches and geo-spatial queries as well. On another I am working with <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a> to provide the exact same
set of searching capability. In other instances, I have to deal with legacy code which requires legacy versions of PHP and the rest of the
technology stack used.</p>
