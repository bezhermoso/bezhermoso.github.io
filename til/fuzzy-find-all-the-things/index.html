      <p>There is nothing much to say other than that <em>junegunn</em>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">fzf</code> is an awesome utility. It accepts a list of things and provides an interface to fuzzy-find through them. Its output is simply the string that you have selected. It’s a perfect embodiment of the ideal UNIX program – it does one thing and one thing well.</p>

<p>Here is a super simple example:</p>

<div class="padded">
    <div class="terminal">
      <div class="icons"><span></span></div>
      <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">ps aux | fzf | awk 'print $2' | xargs kill</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>We are piping the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ps aux</code> – a list of running processes – into <code class="highlighter-rouge">fzf</code>, which allows you to fuzzy-find through them. Once you find the process that you like and hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">Return</code>, the line is piped into <code class="highlighter-rouge">awk 'print $2'</code> which grabs the PID (which is the second column, hence <code class="highlighter-rouge">$2</code>). The PID is then ultimately piped into <code class="highlighter-rouge">xargs kill</code> which results in exactly what we want: <code class="highlighter-rouge">kill &lt;PID&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Another quick, illustrative example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim $(find . | fzf)</code>: fuzzy-find among the files in the current working directory and edit it in Vim.</p>

  <p>These examples are here more for illustrating the nature of <code class="highlighter-rouge">fzf</code>, and by no means bug-free. See <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code class="highlighter-rouge">fzf</code></a>, especially the the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Examples">various Examples sections</a>, to see
full-fledged, battle-hardened implementations of similar functionality.</p>
